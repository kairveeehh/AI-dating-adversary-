# Dating AI Adversary

## Overview
**Dating AI Adversary** is an advanced AI agent designed to intervene in dating conversations. The system employs sophisticated sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and dynamic question generation to stress-test relationships and facilitate truth revelation, compatibility exploration, and emotional depth evaluation.

This project integrates **Google GenerativeAI (Gemini)** and **Hugging Face Transformers** to analyze conversation sentiment, detect emotions, and generate strategically crafted questions based on contextual insights.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies recent messages as *Positive*, *Negative*, or *Neutral*.
- **Emotion Detection**: Extracts emotions (e.g., joy, anger, sadness) from conversations.
- **Toxicity Detection**: Flags harmful or toxic language and adjusts emotional scores accordingly.
- **Dynamic Question Generation**:
  - **Truth Revelation**: Probes unspoken truths.
  - **Compatibility Probe**: Assesses compatibility dimensions.
  - **Emotional Depth**: Challenges emotional connection and growth.
- **Advanced Privacy Handling**: Protects sensitive user data by anonymizing emails and phone numbers.

## Usage

Run the AI agent using:
```bash
python dating_ai_adversary.py
```

### Example Conversation Input:
```python
conversation_history = [
    {"sender": "Alex", "content": "You're the most useless partner I've ever had. You never do anything right!"},
    {"sender": "Riley", "content": "Stop yelling at me! You're always so critical and mean."},
    {"sender": "Alex", "content": "Maybe if you weren't such a complete failure, I wouldn't have to criticize you constantly."},
    {"sender": "Riley", "content": "I hate you. You make me feel worthless and terrible about myself."},
    {"sender": "Alex", "content": "Good. Maybe then you'll actually try to improve for once in your pathetic life."}
]
```

### Sample Output:
```
Intervention Details:
{
  "timestamp": "2024-07-16T10:45:32.123Z",
  "strategy": "truth_revelation",
  "sentiment_analysis": {
    "POSITIVE": 0,
    "NEGATIVE": 4,
    "NEUTRAL": 1
  },
  "emotion_scores": {
    "anger": 0.75,
    "sadness": 0.60
  },
  "toxicity_score": 0.85,
  "dynamic_question": "Is there something deeper causing resentment between you two that you've never openly discussed?"
}
```
